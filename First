## About Me

Iâ€™m Heba Rasmy, a Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence graduate from the University of Birmingham. I specialize in intelligent systems that combine NLP, machine learning, and full-stack engineering.

Iâ€™m passionate about:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Large Language Models  
- AI-driven education tools  
- End-to-end platform development with Python, FastAPI, React, and MongoDB  

I enjoy turning complex ideas into impactful, user-friendly tools â€” whether itâ€™s building smarter chatbots or creating personalized learning experiences.
